## Dotfiles
 You're dotfiles are how you personalize you're system.These are mine.I recommend that you DO NOT simply copy my scripts, but learn what they do.   
 If you are like me, who loves terminal, you might feel bored after using it for long time. To give it a little customization will boosts you're overall productivity and experience.   
 Dotfiles are meant to be grown organically with you're experience. You can fork my dotfiles and play-around with it ,but i recommend writing you're own dotfiles.   

### Requirements:
1. Linux/WSL/Mac terminal
2. Vim
3. Git (for installation)
